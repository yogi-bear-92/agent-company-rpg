## ü§ñ Automated Workflows

### Issue Automation (`issue-automation.yml`)
- **Auto-labeling**: Automatically assigns labels based on keywords
- **Priority detection**: Identifies critical and high-priority issues
- **Component assignment**: Routes issues to appropriate components
- **Team assignment**: Assigns issues to relevant team members
- **Stale issue management**: Manages inactive issues

### Project Board Sync (`project-board-sync.yml`)
- **Board synchronization**: Keeps project boards updated
- **Status tracking**: Updates issue status based on activity
- **Milestone assignment**: Auto-assigns appropriate milestones
- **Progress monitoring**: Tracks development progress

### Issue Triage (`issue-triage.yml`)
- **Intelligent analysis**: Analyzes new issues for priority and complexity
- **Automated comments**: Adds triage analysis to new issues
- **Complexity estimation**: Estimates effort and time requirements
- **Review flagging**: Flags untriaged issues for human review

### Milestone Management (`milestone-management.yml`)
- **Progress reporting**: Weekly milestone progress reports
- **Risk assessment**: Identifies at-risk or overdue milestones
- **Auto-completion**: Celebrates completed milestones
- **Timeline tracking**: Monitors milestone deadlines

## üìù Issue Templates

```

### Creating Custom Workflows
1. Add new workflow files to `.github/workflows/`
2. Use GitHub Actions and github-script for automation
3. Test workflows in a development repository first
4. Monitor workflow performance and adjust as needed

### Updating Issue Templates
1. Modify templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. Use YAML format for structured templates
3. Include validation requirements
4. Test templates before deploying

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Workflow not running**: Check branch protection rules and permissions
- **Labels not applying**: Verify keyword matching in automation scripts
- **Assignments not working**: Check team member usernames and availability
- **Milestones not updating**: Ensure milestone names match exactly
